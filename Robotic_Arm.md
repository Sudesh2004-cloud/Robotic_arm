# 🤖 Pick and Place Robotic Arm – College Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project showcases a **6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) Pick and Place Robotic Arm** designed for educational and prototype purposes. Built using servo motors and controlled via an Arduino Uno, the robotic arm is capable of performing automated pick-and-place operations with reasonable precision.

This arm was developed as part of a final-year Mechanical Engineering project at **MGMs' Jawaharlal Nehru Engineering College**, demonstrating real-world applications of automation, electronics, and embedded programming.

## 🎯 Features

* 🔄 **6 DOF motion** (Base, Shoulder, Elbow, Wrist, End Rotation, Gripper)
* 🤖 **Fully autonomous pick and place routine**
* 🧠 **Arduino-controlled** using preprogrammed motion sequences
* 🧱 **3D printed PLA frame**: lightweight and modular
* 🔌 **Servo-based actuation** for smooth and precise movement
* 🧪 Fully tested for repeatability, load capacity, and motion accuracy
